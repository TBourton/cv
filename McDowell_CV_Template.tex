		\begin{cvsubsection}{Machine Learning Engineer}{Faculty AI}{July 2022 -- Present}			
			\begin{itemize}
                \item Deployed and built decision intelligence system for financial planning. Deployed using AWS, Kubernetes, FastAPI \& Dagster.
                \item Delivered multiple projects, often as the only engineer on a project. Being the sole point of contact for all Software \& Data Engineering/DevOps/MLOps issues. Additionallyl: interfacing with Data Scientists, non-technical team members \& clients.
				\item Wrote python client for submitting jobs into dagster programatically, and then retriving results from S3.
                \item Set up and designed  ETL, retraining, inference, CI/CD and deployment pipelines.
			\end{itemize}

		\begin{cvsubsection}[2]{Computer Vision \& Machine Learning Engineer}{Nect GmbH}{Dec 2019 -- June 2022}	
			\begin{itemize}
				\item Increased resilience and robustness of microservices stack stack by developing and deploying Message Queue system (Rabbit MQ + Redis) to replace existing REST over HTTP system for microservices.
                \item Built microservices for detecting holograms (YOLO) \& stickers (Scikit learn) on ID documents, matching front + back of ID cards via text match (Tesseract + multiprocessing), Lipreading (Tensorflow). Served them via Flask REST APIs + Docker + Kubernetes.
				\item Increased code-base maintainability by advocating for linting + testing tools and implementing them in CI pipelines.
